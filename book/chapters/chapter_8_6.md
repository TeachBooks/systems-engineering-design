# 8.6. Conclusions

In this chapter we described the steps involved for finding the best fit for purpose engineering design configuration. It takes into account the preferences of each stakeholders and how these relate to design variables and constraints. This ensures finding the most desired design solution that is also feasible.

The six steps described in the previous section are part of a bigger iterative procedure where stakeholders can request modifications of the optimization model. For this we make a distinction between the technical and social cycle. The technical cycle involves the six steps in setting up the optimization model whereas the social cycle involves the usage of the model. After the model has been run it is up to the stakeholders to determine whether their interests are sufficiently taken into account. Especially in the early phases of the creation of the model some objectives might be overlooked or stakeholder may wish to change their weights or the shape of their preference functions. This should be a converging process where after a number of iterations the model is considered a well enough representation of reality.
