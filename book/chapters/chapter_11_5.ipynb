    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Railways and roads often cross each other at evel-crossings. Because heavy vehicles must also be able to cross, the railway crossing is often cast in a concrete foundation. The mechanical properties of this concrete foundation are very different from the foundation of the other parts of the railway track. As a result, transitional radiation occurs during the passage of a train, potentially resulting in faster degradation of the local rail system or a negative passenger experience due to vibrational hindrance. Therefore, a transition zone is created by varying the number of sleepers and the distance between them to contribute to a smoother transition,\n",
    "which should have a positive effect on both operational performance and passenger comfort."

    "- **Step 1: Specify the design variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, this design depends on a multitude of design variables, but for now, it will be limited to just two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $F1 = x1 > 0$: the distance between the sleepers. Sleepers are the concrete (or sometimes wooden) beams that support the rails, as part of the ballast bed.\n",
    "2. $F2 = x2(≥ 1)$: the number of sleepers in the transition zone. The transition\n",
    "zone consists of a different type of sleeper than the rest of the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key design performance functions describing the dynamic behaviour of the track at the level-crossing transition zone are the force $F3 = F(x1, x2)$ and the acceleration $F4 = a(x1, x2)$. These are usually the result of extensive numerical finite element and/or analytical calculations. For this design application, the physical/mechanical relationships between the design variables are simplified by using interpolation of discrete numerical calculations derived from a finite element based structural dynamic model (Shang et al., 2023). These interpolated results are the input to the design performance functions."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, three objective functions are investigated in this design application: maintenance costs, travel comfort and investment costs. Given these\n",
    "three objectives, the optimal design for the level-crossing zone is determined. The\n",
    "objective functions read as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maintenance costs (OPEX)** are the key driver for the design of the level crossing\n",
    "transition zones. Large forces and accelerations will have a negative effect on\n",
    "the degradation of the track and foundations, resulting in increased maintenance costs. Hence, this objective can be written as a function of the force and acceleration. For that purpose, the force and acceleration are normalised and combined\n",
    "via the root sum of the square. The final maintenance costs per year objective\n",
    "reads as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O_M = \\sqrt{{F_N}^2 + {a_N}^2} \\cdot 15,000 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_N = \\frac{F - F_{\\text{min}}}{F_{\\text{max}} - F_{\\text{min}}}; \\quad a_N = \\frac{a - a_{\\text{min}}}{a_{\\text{max}} - a_{\\text{min}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and where $O_M$ expresses the OPEX per year in EUR. Note that at the level of design performance functions (i.e., apability-object level), it holds that $F3 = F$ and $F4 = a$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Passenger travel comfort** is an important consideration in railway design.\n",
    "When the dynamic behaviour (due to transition accelerations) during a passage\n",
    "of a level-crossing is substantial, it may lead to a negative travel experience or,\n",
    "in the worst case, to minor mishaps in the train (falling while walking, spilling\n",
    "drinks, etc.). To integrate this into the design problem, an objective is added that\n",
    "describes travel comfort as a function of the normalised acceleration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O_C = 1 − a_N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Investment costs (CAPEX)** must be considered as a key decision-making\n",
    "parameter. The installation of more sleepers will result in higher investment costs.\n",
    "However, more sleepers spread out over a greater distance will also mean that\n",
    "the investment costs for other parts of the rail will be reduced. Therefore, the\n",
    "investment costs objective can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O_I = 1000 x_2 − 350 x_1 x_2$$\n",
