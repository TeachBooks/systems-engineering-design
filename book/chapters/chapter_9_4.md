# 9.4. Conclusion

The illustrative examples show how design problems in the domain of architecture and urban planning can be solved using the preference-based design methodology. We stress that the process typically involves 2 cycles: 
1) the **technical cycle** - which is mainly about the creation and verification of the mathematical model 
2) the **social cycle** - which is mainly about the use and validation of the model.

To prevent confusion about **verification** and **validation**:

 - **Verification** is related to the question: *did we build the model right?*
 - **Validation** is related to the question: *did we build the right model?*
