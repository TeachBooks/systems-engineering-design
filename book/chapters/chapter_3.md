Engineers commonly use models that represent real life systems to carry out simulations that in turn are used to support managerial or technical decision making. Building full size engineering artifacts and evaluating these on the required functionality is costly and time consuming. The use of models can greatly reduce the cost and time for evaluating candidate engineering design solutions. In this chapter the basics of modeling and simulation are described.
