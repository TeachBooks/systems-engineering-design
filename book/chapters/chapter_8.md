This chapter describes the Preference-based Design methodology for solving engineering design problems using mathematical modeling and optimization. Before introducing the methodology itself, we introduce a generic problem conceptualization as proposed by Ackoff[^1]. We then show how Dym[^2] conceptualizes problems in the domain of engineering design. These two combined lead to a generic conceptualization of PBED problems.
