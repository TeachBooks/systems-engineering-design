    "\n",
    "Consider a bridge design where we limit the design problem to the determination of\n",
    "the optimal span and the clearance height of the bridge. Assume that there are two\n",
    "decision makers (stakeholders) that have conflicting interests: \n",
    "1) the municipality interested in the costs of the bridge, and \n",
    "2) the waterway users interested in the\n",
    "waiting time when the bridge is closed for waterway users. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Specify the design variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem we have two controllable design variables:\n",
    "1) the bridge span $x_1$ and \n",
    "2) the clearance height of the bridge $x_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Retrieve decision maker's objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The municipality wants the cost to be minimised which becomes the first objective function $O_1$, whereas the waterway users want the waiting time to be minimised which becomes the second objective function $O_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3: Determine the preference functions for each objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs are a function of the material use which in turn is a function of both the span and clearance height. We assume a linear relationship between costs $O_1$ and material use $F_1$ defined by coefficient $c_1 = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O_1 = c_1 F_1$$\n",

    "For this problem the weights are assumed to be equal, i.e. $w_1 = w_2 = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
