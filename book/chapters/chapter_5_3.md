# 5.3. Conclusion

We define the optimal choice as the alternative having the highest overall preference rating (which is a function of weights attached to criteria and preference ratings attached to alternatives by decision makers) and meets all veto-criteria [^veto-criteria].


[^veto-criteria]: Veto-criteria are predefined conditions or thresholds that must be satisfied for an alternative to be considered viable in a decision-making process.
