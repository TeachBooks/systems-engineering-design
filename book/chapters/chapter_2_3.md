# 2.3. Conclusion

Although **research** and **design** have opposite reasoning directions, they are closely related. Engineering design for a large extent relies on scientific knowledge. Conversely, to carry out scientific research some artifacts may need to be designed.

The picture at the beginning of this chapter showed a model of an airplane to be designed in a wind tunnel. This is a clear example of where science and design can meet each other.[^ref]
